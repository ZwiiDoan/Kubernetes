### IP Forwarding
# On a Linux system the Linux kernel has a variable named 
# `ip_forward` that keeps this value. It is accessible using 
# the file `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`. The default value 
# is 0 which means no IP Forwarding, because a regular user 
# who runs a single computer without further components is 
# not in need of that, usually.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

### Address Resolution Protocol
# Viewing and modifying the local Address Resolution Protocol 
# (ARP) cache, which contains recently resolved MAC addresses of 
# Internet Protocol (IP) hosts on the network

### The network statistics ( netstat )
# The network statistics ( netstat ) command is a networking tool 
# used for troubleshooting and configuration, that can also serve 
# as a monitoring tool for connections over the network.
