---
- Kubelet can manage pod independently
- Kubelet can read Pod manifests from a configured directory 
and create/manage pods lifecycle according to those manifests
- Those pods are static pods.
---
Configure static pods path when running kubelet.service
ExecStart=...
  --pod-manifest-path=/etc/Kubernetes/manifests \\
...

ExecStart=...
  --config=kubeconfig.yaml \\
...
in kubeconfig.yaml
staticPodPath: /etc/Kubernetes/manifests
---
When working with kube-apiserver, kubelet creates a read-only 
mirror object in kube-apiserver for every static pod.
---
Use case: deploy all control plane components as static pods
---
ssh node01 #switch to another node
logout #go back to master
---
ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep config #find kubelet config file location
grep -i static /path/to/kubelet/config/file #find static pods directory
