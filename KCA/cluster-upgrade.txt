# Default wait time for a node to recover is 5 minutes

kubectl cordon node-2

# Kubernetes Software Versions:
# v1.11.3
# [major-version].[minor-version].[patch]

# kube-apiserver should have the highest version comparing to
# other controllers/components in controlplane
- kube-apiserver: version x
- controller-amanger: version x (-1)
- kube-scheduler: verion x (-1)
- kubelet: version x (-2)
- kube-proxy: version x (-2)

# kubectl can have higher version than kube-apiserver
- kubectl: x (+1/-1)

# Kubernetes only support 2 latest order versions
i.e: v1.12 supports v1.11 and v1.10
It's recommended to upgrade 1 minor version at a time:
- v1.10 -> v1.11
- v1.11 -> v1.12
Before v1.13 release is a good time to upgrade from v1.10 -> v1.11

# Upgrade with kubeadm
kubectl upgrade plan
kubectl upgrade apply

# Upgrade master node first then 
- upgrade worker node in sequence or
- add new node with new software version, move workload from old
node to new node, remove old node => repeat until all nodes
are upgraded

# Kubeadm cluster upgrade instructions:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/

# Identify the OS of the node:
cat /etc/*release*

# Upgrade master/controlplane node
