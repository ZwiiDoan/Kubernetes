### Switching
- A switch connects multiple devices in a network
- Each host needs an interface to connect to the switch
- show network interface eth0:
ip link

- assign an IP address to each host:
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
ip addr add 192.168.1.11/24 dev eth0

- then a host can reach another through the switch:
ping 192.168.1.11

### Routing
- A Router connects multiple networks
- Router is assigned an address in each network, e.g:
192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1

### Gateway/Route
- Gateway is the door of a network to go out to the internet or 
another network
- See existing routing config of a network/system:
ip route

- Add a route for host 1 (192.168.1.10) in network 1 (192.168.1.0) 
to reach hosts in network 2 (192.168.2.0) via router (192.168.1.1)
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1

- Add a default route for hosts in network 2 (192.168.2.0) to reach
other networks or internet via router (192.168.2.1):
ip route add default via 192.168.2.1
- or:
ip route add 0.0.0.0 via 192.168.2.1 (0.0.0.0 means any destinations)
| Destination | Gateway     | Genmask       | ... | Iface |
| 0.0.0.0     | 192.168.1.1 | 255.255.255.0 | ... | eth0  |

- If an entry in route table has 0.0.0.0 as the gateway address, 
it means there is no gateway required, e.g: access other hosts in 
the same network

| Destination | Gateway | Genmask       | ... | Iface |
| 192.168.1.0 | 0.0.0.0 | 255.255.255.0 | ... | eth0  |

- There can be separated gateways for internet and intranet access
| Destination | Gateway     | Genmask       | ... | Iface |
| default     | 192.168.1.2 | 255.255.255.0 | ... | eth0  |
| 192.168.2.0 | 192.168.1.1 | 255.255.255.0 | ... | eth0  |

###  Configure a Linux host as a router
Network 1: 192.168.1.0
- Host A: 192.168.1.5
- Host B: 192.168.1.6 (eth1)
Network 2: 192.168.2.0
- Host B: 192.168.2.6
- Host C: 192.168.2.5 (eth0)

- Configure route in host A to reach host C via host B:
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.6
- and vice versa in host C:
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.6

- Allow host B to forward network traffice between 2 network 
interfaces (eth0 and eth1):
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
- To persist this change permanently:
vi /etc/sysctl.conf
- Change:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
