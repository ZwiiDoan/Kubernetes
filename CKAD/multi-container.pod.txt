# InitContainer
# When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, 
# and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion 
# before the real container hosting the application starts.
# You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, 
# like how we did for multi-pod containers. In that case each 
# init container is run one at a time in sequential order.
